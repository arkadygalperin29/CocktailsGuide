Rewriting an app from aug. 2023 which was trying to write as fast as possible not caring about architecture or anything.

Current one illustrates more skill and understanding how would I write from 0.

Working on it when can and have a passion besides main job. Currently contains 7 modules + folder for feature modules which may increase. It will be native android so no Koin, using compile-time Hilt.

Navigation is Voyager with hilt plugin. Planning to write tests later, at least for features (should be around 4-5 features, not too complicated). Also planning to install and configure detekt.

Currently WIP, most recent update may be in one of feature branches.

Stack: Compose, Voyager, Room, Retrofit, Dagger-Hilt, Coroutines, MVVM, modularization, JUnit, Mockk, detekt
